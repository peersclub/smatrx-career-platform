  - Technical (25%): GitHub activity, code quality, consistency, language diversity
  - Social (15%): Followers, engagement, platform diversity, content quality
  - Certifications (15%): Verified certs, prestige, recency

- **Badge System**: 11 different achievement badges
  - Academic Excellence, Top Institution Graduate
  - Industry Veteran, Leadership Role
  - Active Developer, Polyglot Developer, Code Quality Champion

**Algorithm Highlights**:
```typescript
// Example: GitHub contribution scoring
const activityScore = {
  repos: min(20, totalRepos * 0.5),
  commits: min(15, totalCommits * 0.001),
  prs: min(10, totalPRs * 0.5),
  stars: min(10, totalStars * 0.1)
}

// Social influence (logarithmic scale for followers)
const followerScore = min(35, log10(totalFollowers + 1) * 10)

// Overall score = weighted sum of all components
overallScore = (education * 0.25) + (experience * 0.20) +
               (technical * 0.25) + (social * 0.15) +
               (certifications * 0.15)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### Why Prisma?
- Type-safe database queries
- Easy migrations
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Already used in existing codebase

### Why Separate Services?
- **Modularity**: Each service has single responsibility
- **Testability**: Easy to unit test in isolation
- **Reusability**: Services can be called from multiple routes
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns

### Why OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo?
- Most advanced reasoning for career recommendations
- JSON mode for structured output
- 128k context window (can handle large profiles)
- Good balance of cost and quality

### Why Multi-Model Database Design?
- **Flexibility**: Each data source has unique attributes
- **Scalability**: Can add new sources without schema changes
- **Verification**: Separate tracking for each verification type
- **Privacy**: Granular control over what data to show publicly
