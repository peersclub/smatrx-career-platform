## 🔄 CI/CD Integration

### **GitHub Actions** (Recommended)

Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Production

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm install -g pnpm
      - run: pnpm install
      - run: pnpm test
      - run: pnpm lint
      - run: pnpm tsc --noEmit

  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: npm install -g pnpm vercel
      - run: ./scripts/deploy.sh production
        env:
          VERCEL_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}
```

### **Manual Deployment**

For smaller teams or initial deployment:
```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh production
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Deployment Fails**

1. Check prerequisites:
   ```bash
   node --version  # Should be 18+
   pnpm --version
   vercel --version
   ```

2. Verify environment variables:
   ```bash
   vercel env ls
   ```

3. Check database connection:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/db-setup.sh check
   ```

4. Review deployment logs:
   ```bash
   vercel logs [deployment-url]
   ```

### **Migration Errors**

1. Check migration status:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/db-setup.sh status
   ```

2. Validate schema:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/db-setup.sh validate
   ```

3. If migrations are out of sync:
   ```bash
   # ⚠️ Development only!
   ./scripts/db-setup.sh reset
   ```

### **Health Check Failing**

1. Visit `/api/health` directly
2. Check database connection
3. Verify Redis connection
4. Review error logs in Sentry
